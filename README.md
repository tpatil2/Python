-BUG 1
---------------------
## In bool ConnectX::inBounds(int w, int h)
<pre>
bool ConnectX::inBounds(int w, int h)
{
	bool inside;
	if( w>=width || w<0 )
		inside = false;-------------|
	else                          |-------|
		inside = true;--------------|       |
                                        |
                                        |--there is conflict in
	if( h<0 || h>=height )                |  value of 'inside'
		inside = false;-------------|       |  reset to true or false
	else                          |-------|
		inside = true;--------------|

	return inside;
}
</pre>
This function checks for given location
if it inside board returns inside = true else returns false

but if input 'w' is out side board it sets value of inside (w>=width || w<0) to false and it
checks for input 'h' if its inside board then it sets value of 'inside'=false, but practically
given location is out of board. So this function doesn't work properly.



-BUG 2
-------------------

## In ConnectX::ConnectX(int wide, int high, int x)

If values of wide hign and x are less than or equal to zero then
these values are set to Default values

**LINE NO 9:**
This doesn't consider the case when high with and x are equal to 1
if it accepts 1 then following problems will occure

- If dimention is det to 1x1 then  only one player can play
- First player will always win because value of towin is 1
- second player will never get chance to play.



-BUG 3
--------------------
## In function  void ConnectX::placePiece(int column)

for bad input value of column -1 it gives codedump
*** Error in `./ConnectXTest': free(): invalid next size (fast): 0x000000000181a5f0 ***
Aborted (core dumped)



-BUG 4
----------------------
## ConnectX::ConnectX(8,8,100)

- this function accepts value of 'towin' greater than the size of board
- length of 'towin'  must be less than or equal to Diagonal length of board
